## OpenMPC - an open and flexible MPC toolkit for teaching and research

This repo contains OpenMPC, an open, flexible and easy-to-use MPC toolkit for teaching and research. It contains functionality for linear and nonlinear MPC, along with invariant set computations. The optimization relies on cvxpy (for linear MPC) and casadi (for nonlinear MPC). It is compatible with the control package (for both linear and nonlinear systems), and contains invariant set functionality based on cddlib.
