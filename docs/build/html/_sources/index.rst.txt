Welcome to OpenMPC's documentation
==================================================

OpenMPC is a Python library designed to make Model Predictive Control (MPC) more accessible to students and researchers. 
Developed as an educational toolbox for teaching MPC at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, OpenMPC provides a collection of intuitive and modular functionalities to explore the core principles of MPC.

The library includes tools for system modeling, filtering, invariant set computation, and both linear and nonlinear MPC, enabling users to experiment with and understand different aspects of predictive control. 
With a focus on clarity and usability, OpenMPC serves as a learning aid for students who want to develop a solid foundation in MPC and its applications.

Whether you're new to MPC or looking for an interactive way to test advanced control strategies, OpenMPC provides a structured and hands-on approach to learning and implementing MPC techniques.
